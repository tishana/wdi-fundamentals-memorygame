    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
    <h3> Why I think it's fun...</h3>
    <p>I've played the Memory Card Game since I was very young. It's a great way for small children to feel like they are playing a 'grown-up' game. You can easily add familiar or new images to teach children anything.</p>
